## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using Machine Learning techniques. By analyzing medical attributes such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical features, the model learns patterns that help classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease or not.

The project demonstrates the complete Machine Learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in reducing risks and improving patient outcomes. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can assist in identifying patients at risk of heart disease based on historical medical data.

## 📊 Dataset

* The dataset contains patient health records with multiple numerical and categorical features.
* Target variable:

  * `1` → Presence of heart disease
  * `0` → No heart disease
* Missing values and data distributions are handled during preprocessing and EDA.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to:

* Understand feature distributions
* Identify correlations between features
* Analyze the relationship between medical factors and heart disease
* Detect outliers and missing values

Visualizations such as bar plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps are used to gain insights.
